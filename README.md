# Q-Learning-AI-CS370

This assignment utilizes greedy q-learning to determine the optimal move for a min-max pacman game. The primary implementations of my personal code involved the valueIterationAgents.py, qLearningAgents.py, and analysis.py

Each of these files were used respectively to determine the value iteration aent for solving known MDPs, Q-learning agents for the potential landscapes of pacman,
