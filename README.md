# Q-Learning-AI-CS370

This assignment utilizes greedy q-learning to determine the optimal move for a min-max pacman game. The primary implementations of my personal code involved the valueIterationAgents.py and qLearningAgents.py

Each of these files were used respectively to determine the value iteration aent for solving known MDPs and Q-learning agents for the landscapes of pacman.
